Remix of the [CMPSR - Foldable Shoulder Rest For Violin by Sleighbells64_220416 on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/441235-cmpsr-foldable-shoulder-rest-for-violin)

## Modifications by @phansel:

- Increase length of the center rest by 3% to better fit a different brand of violin.
- Change screw hole diameter to be compatible with M3 bolts rather than M5 screws.

## Description
     The CMPSR is an open source 3D printed folding shoulder for violin. This prints with minimal supports, and the areas which do require supports are covered by the foam pad. This fits a standard full size violin.

## Materials

(4) M5x10mm bolts - the length isn't super important, between 5 and 15mm (that's between 0.0005468 and 0.0001640 football fields for my Imperial unit friends)

(1) little pad of foam you can get at any home improvement store or any other cushioning material

Duct tape or Packing Tape - to put into the slots to grip the violin and prevent scratching

Filament, preferably PETG, print PLA at your own risk, I haven't tried it.

 

## Background/Trivia (The part you probably don't care about)

     This shoulder rest was initially designed after I lost mine the day before a concert. That last minute scramble turned out to be surprisingly comfortable and durable. Now the design has been improved with the use of foam padding and 4 self tapping m5 screws to be easier to assemble and more comfortable to wear. i have used it for several months and haven't had any issues with breaking or wearing out. I decided to put this out when I saw the Musical Instrument Contest and thought it might be fun.

 

## Printing Instructions  (The part you probably DO care about)

     I would recommend printing this out of PETG to make sure it can flex a little. I would recommend printing this with 0.2mm layer height and 3 perimeters, I also used 20% Gyroid Infill but I don't know how much the infill type effects it. The two end pieces print with no supports, the middle rail section HAS supports, print it with the bottom facing towards your bed

 

## Assembly Instructions

    Using the numbers on the end caps and board, match them onto their proper sides. 
    screw in the m5 screws with a screwdriver, they should self-tap the board and end piece, don't overtighten or they will strip out the holes
      using glue, tape, spray adhesive, or whatever stickiness you can get your hands on, attach the foam or other padding to the bottom of the main beam. 
    VERY IMPORTANT! put little strips of duct tape or packing tape into the slots of the end caps to keep them from scratching the violin and keep the shoulder rest securely attached.

## Q/A

Q: Why shouldn't I just buy a cheap shoulder rest?

A: How else are you gonna justify spending all that money on a 3D printer?

Q: why should it be printed out of PETG?

A: PETG has a lot more flexibility to it than PLA and it's the material I used, this shoulder rest needs to flex a little bit to provide some clamping force onto the side of the instrument. Printing it out PLA would cause it to be a lot stiffer and clamp harder, as well as making it more fragile. - TLDR because I know it works.

Q: why is “Malleable” in the acronym for CMPSR?

 A: This shoulder rest, like most other designs, relies on the flexibility i.e. malleability of the central bar to provide a little bit of clamping force to keep it attached to the violin. The malleability is important, so it goes in the acronym.

Q: that last answer sounds like a weak justification so you could spell out composer

A: ………….Yeah, okay you got me. I came up with the C, P, S, and R, first and really wanted to try and make it spell out composer. Can you blame me though? Everyone loves a good acronym.

## DISCLAIMER:
I am not responsible for any scratches or other damage you may do to your violin, yourself, or others. How would you hurt others with a shoulder rest? I have no idea, but don't do it, and if you do it, don't blame me. Print and use this at your own risk.
